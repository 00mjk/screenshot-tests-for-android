## Getting Started


First you need to [setup the gradle plugin](docs/gradle-setup/).

Then [create a screenshot in a test](docs/creating-a-screenshot/)!

We [talked about screenshot-tests-for-android](https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=Vi9CdkY9-YI&u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DNo6iZIbh59Q%26feature%3Dshare)
at Droidcon NYC 2015, and this is a good introduction to the concepts
involved, even though the API might be slightly different.
