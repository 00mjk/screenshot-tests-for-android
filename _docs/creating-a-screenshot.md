Creating a screenshot from within a test is very easy.You can do this from either JUnit4 style or JUnit3 style instrumentation test.

```java
public class MyTests {
  @Test
  public void doScreenshot() {
    /*
     * Create and set up your view some how. This might be inflating,
     * or creating from a view class. You might want to set properties
     * on the view.
     */
    View view = mLayoutInflater.inflate(R.layout.my_layout, null, false);

    /*
     * Measure and layout the view. In this example we give an exact
     * width but all the height to be WRAP_CONTENT.
     */
    ViewHelpers.setupView(view)
      .setExactWidthDp(300)
      .layout();

    /*
     * Take the actual screenshot. At the end of this call the screenshot
     * is stored on the device, and the gradle plugin takes care of
     * pulling it and displaying it to you in nice ways.
     */
    Screenshot.snap(view)
      .record();
  }
}
```

We have an example of this at [SearchBarTest.java](https://github.com/facebook/screenshot-tests-for-android/blob/master/examples/one/src/androidTest/java/com/facebook/testing/screenshot/SearchBarTest.java). You can generate your screenshots using

```bash
$ gradle screenshotTests
```

For instance, [here's the output generated by our included example test](static/rendering.png).
